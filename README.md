# Vandana Shiva tribute page #

> I chose to create a tribute page to Vandana Shiva as she was my favourite acadmic during my masters programme and I am passionate about ecofeminist principles. 

> During the process I learned the importance of parctise to really learn code and how long this journey will be. 

> I hope to be able to go back and add more features and content to the tribute page as my learning continues.
